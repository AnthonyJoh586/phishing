        We understand being listed on a Phishing Database like this can be frustrating and embarrassing for many web site owners.

        The first step is to remain calm.
        
        The second step is to rest assured one of our maintainers will address your issue as soon as possible.

        Please make sure you have provided as much information and details as possible to help speed up the processing of your whitelisting application.
